              Hello, my name is Tyler Moore and with the help of many people I
              made this template. I made it so it is super easy to update and so
              that it flows perfectly with my tutorials. Lots of love and
              hundreds of hours went into making it. I hope you love it as much
              as I do.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wish you the best of luck with your business, enjoy the
              adventure.
            </p>
